Code for Guthman et al 2019

These scripts are for use in analyzing data recorded from neurons in (primarly) whole cell patch clamp configuration. Data should be recorded as .abf files using pClamp software to be compatible with the codes. These scripts have been used and tested on data from pClamp ver 10.x and are compatible with those .abf data files.

Most scripts were written by E Mae Guthman, with some noted exceptions:

-- scripts with "dr" or "drg" in the title were written by Diego Restrepo

-- Guthman 2019 decision tree 2.R was written by Philip Chu with packages created by Andy Liaw and Matthew Wiener (random forest), Terry Therneau and Beth Atkinson (rpart), Stephen Milborrow (rpart.plot), and Graham J. Williams (rattle).

-- abfload.m was written by: % CONTRIBUTORS % Original version by Harald Hentschke (harald.hentschke@uni-tuebingen.de) % Extended to abf version 2.0 by Forrest Collman (fcollman@Princeton.edu) % pvpmod.m by Ulrich Egert (egert@bccn.uni-freiburg.de)
